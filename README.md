# MatchThreeUnity
A generic Match 3 game in Unity3D.
Tiles are represented by color, but can easily be replaced by other match 
systems. Rather than a normal grid system, tiles are driven using Unity's
physics system. As tiles stop falling, colliders are used to detect
neighbors, and are run through a check that detects if three or more meet
match conditions.

This project also demonstrates various other basic techniques for a
match 3 game, including a short delay before destruction to allow the
player to create more interesting matches, a combo system, and bonus points
for getting more tiles in a single match.

You are free to use this as the basis of your own projects, but be aware
that it is not 100% production-ready code, and it is not optimized for mobile.
